- Age differences between prize categories
- Oldest and youngest winners
- You get a prize!

### Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting field of study for data scientists where they develop algorithms that can make sense out of conversational language used by humans. In this Project, you will use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.

- Which movies are most similar?


### Generating Keywords for Google Ads
You work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. You are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With your Python skills, you will efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.

###### Project tasks  include:
- The brief
- Combine the words with the product names
- Convert the list of lists into a DataFrame
- Rename the columns of the DataFrame
- Add a campaign column
- Create the match type column
- Duplicate all the keywords into 'phrase' match
- Save and summarize!


### Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding! Check out this short demo:

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

###### Project tasks  include:
- Of cats and cookies
- The AB-test data
- The distribution of game rounds
- Overall 1-day retention
- 1-day retention by AB-group
- Should we be confident in the difference?
- Zooming in on the difference
- The probability of a difference
- 7-day retention by AB-group
- Bootstrapping the difference again
- The conclusion


### Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

###### Project tasks  include:
- Credit card applications
- Inspecting the applications
- Handling the missing values (part i)
- Handling the missing values (part ii)
- Handling the missing values (part iii)
- Preprocessing the data (part i)
- Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
- Preprocessing the data (part ii)
- Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
- Making predictions and evaluating performance
- Grid searching and making the model perform better
- Finding the best performing model


### Real-time Insights from Social Media Data
Fear of missing out, curiosity, self-esteem, speed: it's like social media has changed our basic human needs; these baits are keeping us hooked and engaged. And Twitter is a master at this game. Elon Musk's tweets keep Wall Street on its toes; Trump's tweets have the potential of starting wars â€” Twitter has this huge influence on the world because of the type of its users. Data from Twitter-storms is available in near real-time. This means we can learn about the big waves of thoughts and moods around the world as they arise. So of course, we are not going to miss the chance to analyze this treasure trove.

In this Project, we use pre-downloaded datasets to understand the nuts and bolts of Twitter Data. In particular, we  do a thorough analysis of a hot-trend.

###### Project tasks  include:
- Local and global thought patterns
- Prettifying the output
- Finding common trends
- Exploring the hot trend
- Digging deeper
- Frequency analysis
- Activity around the trend
- A table that speaks a 1000 words
- Analyzing used languages
- Final thoughts


### Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio
When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.

In this project, we  apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas.
 

###### Project tasks  include:
- Meet Professor William Sharpe
- A first glance at the data
- Plot & summarize daily prices for Amazon and Facebook
- Visualize & summarize daily values for the S&P 500
- The inputs for the Sharpe Ratio: Starting with Daily Stock Returns
- Daily S&P 500 returns
- Calculating Excess Returns for Amazon and Facebook vs. S&P 500
- The Sharpe Ratio, Step 1: The Average Difference in Daily Returns Stocks vs S&P 500
- The Sharpe Ratio, Step 2: Standard Deviation of the Return Difference
- Putting it all together
- Conclusion

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, you will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

###### Project tasks  include:

### Up and Down With the Kardashians
In this Project, you will explore the data underneath the hype in the form of search interest data from Google Trends. You'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of your own. And you'll answer the big question: is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?

###### Project tasks  include:
- The sisters and Google Trends
- Better "kolumn" names
- Pesky data types
- From object to integer

### Word Frequency in Moby Dick
In this Project, we scrape the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then you'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.

###### Project tasks  include:
- Tools for text processing
- Request Moby Dick
- Get the text from the HTML
- Extract the words
- Make the words lowercase
- Load in stop words
- Remove stop words in Moby Dick
